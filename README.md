# Feature Samples for WinForms Map Kit

In the [previous thread](https://github.com/SlimGIS/QuickstartSampleForWinForms), we guided you to walk through a simple quick start sample of SlimGIS MapKit for WinForms. In this thread, we will show you more features. Here is a preview of our samples.

Here is a 3-minutes video

In the basic samples, we will show you 6 kinds of features.

1. Geometry
2. Layers
3. Projection
4. Spatial Functions
5. Style and Renderer
6. WinForms Specific

## Geometry
In this GIS word, geometry (; geo = earth, metria = measure) is a part of mathematics concerned with questions of size, shape, and relative position of figures and with properties of space. With SlimGIS MapKit, we could create various different geometries and manything related.

## Layer
Layer represents a low-level slice that could renders raster and vectors. In this category, we will show you most data source that SlimGIS MapKit support. We will support more popular data format in the near future.

## Projection
A map projection is one of many methods used to represent the 3-dimensional surface of the earth or other round body on a 2-dimensional plane in cartography (mapmaking). In this category, we will show you few common re-projected map. We support more than showing you in the sample :)

## Spatial Functions
Spatial data refers to information about the location and shape of, and relationships among, geographic features, usually stored as coordinates and topology. Spatial data functions are used to transform spatial data files, such as digitized map, edit them, and assess their accuracy. This category will represent you part of the spatial analysis functions we have.

## Style and Renderers
Styles and renderers are the objects that are used to render the spatial data. With SlimGIS MapKit styles and renderers, we can easily add styles for area, linear and points; also more advanced thematic styles and heat styles.

## WinForms Specific
In this part, we will show you more specific features that only WinForms owns. We have many build-in features like popup, marker, track & editi, map controls and more. Take a tour here.
